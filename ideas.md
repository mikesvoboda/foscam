### **2. 🏠 Smart Home Integration**

#### **Automated Response System**
```python
# Example integration possibilities
class SmartHomeIntegration:
    def process_alert(self, alert_type, camera_location, confidence):
        if alert_type == "person_detected" and camera_location == "frontyard":
            self.turn_on_porch_light()
            self.send_notification_to_phone()
        elif alert_type == "motion_detected" and confidence > 0.9:
            self.activate_security_mode()
```

**Integration Opportunities:**
- **Home Assistant/OpenHAB**: Trigger lights, locks, alarms based on detections
